- paradigm of storing all the configuration in vcs is known as infrastructure
as a code (IAC).

- since the configuration stored in files, those files can be stored in
vcs

- vcs gives us:
1. audit trail of changes
2. quickly rollback if a changes was wrong
3. lets other review our code to catch error and distribute knowledge
4. let us easily check out the state of our infrastructure by looking
at the rules that are commited.

example of configuration management system:
1. puppet
2. chef
3. ansible
4 cfengine
