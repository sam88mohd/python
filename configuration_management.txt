- paradigm of storing all the configuration in vcs is known as infrastructure
as a code (IAC).

- since the configuration stored in files, those files can be stored in
vcs

- vcs gives us:
1. audit trail of changes
2. quickly rollback if a changes was wrong
3. lets other review our code to catch error and distribute knowledge
4. let us easily check out the state of our infrastructure by looking
at the rules that are commited.

- example of configuration management system:
1. puppet
2. chef
3. ansible
4 cfengine

puppet
------

- typicaly deploy puppet using a client-server architecture

- client: puppet agent
- server: puppet master

- agent connect to the master and sends bunch of facts that describe
the computer to the master

- master the proccess this info, generate the list of rules that need to be
applied to the device and send this list back to the agent

- agent is then in charge to making anu neccessary changes on the computer.

- puppet will determine the type of os being use and select the right tool
to perform the package installation.

- for linux, use apt, yum , dnf
- for mac - Apple Provider is used for packages are part of the os
            - MacPorts used package from MacPorts project
- for windows - need extra attributes, stating where is the installer located.

basic unit of puppet: resources - package, file 

class sudo {
    package { 'sudo':
        ensure => present,
        }
}
